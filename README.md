# Rent A Car App
Rent a Car application developed by using java in OOP and SOLID principles' frame, which allows the users to rent cars according to their customer membership types (individual or corporate).

## Rule Set:
* In a car rental company, vehicles can be rented in the following types: SUV, Sedan, and Hatchback.
* Sedans and Hatchbacks can be rented either monthly or daily, while SUVs can only be rented on a daily basis.
* Vehicles can be rented by individual customers or companies. However, individual customers can only rent Hatchback and Sedan vehicles, while companies can rent all types of vehicles.
* This means that if a user logs in as an individual customer, they can only see Hatchback and Sedan vehicles. If the user is a company, they can see all vehicle models.
* For each customer, attributes such as name (first and last name for individuals, company name for companies), phone number, national ID number for individual customers, and tax number for companies must be included.
Various features should be added to the vehicles (e.g., brand, model, segment, gear type, trunk capacity, color, age, fuel type, daily rental cost, etc.). Some of these features may be the same for certain vehicles, while others should be customized.
* The rental options for each vehicle, whether monthly or daily, vary depending on the model.
